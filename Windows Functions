-- A Window Function in SQL performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are related to the current row,
-- known as the "window," without collapsing the rows into a single output.
-- Unlike standard aggregate functions (like SUM with GROUP BY), 
-- window functions retain the original detail rows while adding a new column that contains the aggregated or calculated result for that row's window.

-- Comparison
-- SUM with GROUP BY: This shows the total sum of salary of each occupation. The # of rows=the # of occupation
-- You can't add any other columns that aren't added under the group by

SELECT occupation, SUM(salary)
FROM employee_salary
GROUP BY occupation;

-- SUM with OVER(): This shows all the rows with the total sum of the occupation. The # of rows should be the same as the original 
SELECT  occupation, SUM(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY occupation )
FROM employee_salary;
